# OpenAI-Gym-BipedalWalker
A solution to the BipedalWalker-v3 environment as part of a Reinforcement Learning assignment.

This solution builds on a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic model by introducing the system network from the forward-looking actor algorithm - https://github.com/honghaow/FORK

Parts of the model implementation have been adapted from https://github.com/Rafael1s/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/BipedalWalkerHardcore-TD3-FORK
